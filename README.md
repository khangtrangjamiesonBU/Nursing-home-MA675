MA675 - Nursing Home Project
This README shows how to utilize uploaded files.
- For the cleaned dataset (from the beginning of the project), please check out the file "clean dataset-nursing-home.qmd"
- For the initial EDA (from the beginning of the project), please check out the file "Microtransition-EDA-nursing-home.qmd"
- Later in the project, when the project evolved, the code for all the EDA used in the report is in the file "Nursing-home-Model-3-Trang.R"
- The two datasets provided in this repo will be used in the "Nursing-home-Model-3-Trang.R" to create a merged dataset that will be used throughout the whole report.
